# Bugs:

- no validation for server subcommands
- hangs on input stream when unknown command provided
- unclear usage of -g and local for server, simplify this

# Features

- add option to not use quotes on listen, or at least inform user that other parameters are ignored

```js
// The last positional argument can optionally accept an array of values, by using the .. operator:

yargs.command("download <url> [files..]", "download several files").help().argv
```

- add server info command (address, command, pid) - all in one
- option to output from --print and stream as JSON or HTML (raw - false-positives) ??
